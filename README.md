## CVX: Sunglok's OpenCV Extension
_CVX_ aims to provide extended functionality and tools to OpenCV for more convenience. It consists of a single header file, `opencvx.hpp`, which only depends on OpenCV in C++. Just include the file to your project. It will work without complex configuration and dependency. CVX is [Beerware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerware) so that it is free to use and distribute.
